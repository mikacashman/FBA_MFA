# data

Similar to the bin directory this is left over code from the fba_tools module that has been scrapped clean.  This was left as it was anticipated neccesary based on the classifier.txt file.  We do not actively monitor or alter these files.

#### from the sdk readme:
This directory should contain any data required for your module to work that is not already present in KBase.
This includes both reference data for your module to run as well as data used in testing your code.
